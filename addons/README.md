# Addons for Kubernetes

This folder contains some basic addons for kubernetes. Deploy them with kubectl, for most of them you may use the command

```
kubectl apply -f addons/<YOUR_WANTED_ADDON>
```

But for jenkins there is a specific requirement. You may want to look into jenkins folder's README.md.
